# Welcome to Dunya دنيا 🌍

Welcome to the **Dunya Sovereign Intelligence Layer**. This is not just a documentation site; it is the distilled "memory" of our project's AI agent.

### 🌟 The Concept: Sovereign Hybrid AI
We believe in **Data Sovereignty**. 
*   **The Brain is Local**: All sensitive data, audit logs, and beneficiary PII (Personally Identifiable Information) remain on our local, private PC.
*   **The Access is Global**: Via this portal, team members can securely browse the "Knowledge Items" (KIs) that the agent generates. This allows a distributed team to act with the same information as the central coordinator.

### 📖 What are Knowledge Items (KIs)?
KIs are summaries of complex project phases. They capture:
1.  **Truths**: The final working logic of our systems.
2.  **Architectural Decisions**: Why we chose specific tools (like Cloudflare over VPNs).
3.  **Audit Patterns**: How we define "TRUE Debt" and verify transactions.

### 🛡️ Access & Roles
*   **Readers (Team)**: You can browse all KIs here. Learn from past audits, understand the payout patterns, and coordinate with unified context.
*   **Admins (Coordinator)**: Only the admin has the right to view raw beneficiary data or edit the brain's internal logic.

### 🚀 How to Contribute
Communication with the Trustees and the Team should be reflected here. If you identify a new pattern or a frequent issue, inform the Coordinator. The AI will then "distill" that interaction into a new KI for the entire team to see.

**Next Monday is Audit Day.** Use this brain to prepare the context for your upcoming beneficiary communications.
