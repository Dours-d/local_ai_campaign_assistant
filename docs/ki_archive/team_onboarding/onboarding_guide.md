# Mission Onboarding: DUNYA دنيا 🌍

Welcome to the team. You are joining a mission that leverages **Sovereign AI** to maintain radical transparency and operational continuity for the Gaza Resilience Fund.

## 1. The Core Concept: Sovereign Intelligence
Unlike traditional projects that rely on centralized cloud services, our project is **Sovereign**. 
*   **Data Sovereignty**: All sensitive data and beneficiary information live on a private, local machine.
*   **The Brain**: 'DUNYA دنيا' is the agentic memory of the project. It "distills" every major decision, audit, and strategy into **Knowledge Items (KIs)**.

## 2. Knowledge Items (KIs) & Transparency
For our Trustees, KIs represent the **Audit Trail**. 
*   Every time the AI performs an audit or a strategy shift (like the *Ethos Shift 2026*), it generates a KI.
*   Trustees can browse these items to see the exact logic used to manage funds and identify beneficiaries. This ensures no decision is "hidden" inside a black box.

## 3. NOOR نور (Hybrid AI Relay)
To ensure the mission never sleeps, we use a **Hybrid AI Relay** system:

### Phase A: Local Intelligence (Gemma 3)
When the project coordinator's computer is **ON**, you are interacting with **Noor**—powered by a local, private model.

### Phase B: The Scout (DeepSeek Relay)
If the local computer is **OFF**, the system automatically switches to **Relay Mode** using the DeepSeek API. 
*   This acts as an "Outpost." It provides basic assistance and answers questions using cached versions of our Knowledge Items.
*   **Security Shell**: We only send limited, redacted context to the cloud relay.

### Phase C: Intelligence Re-Integration
This is our most advanced feature. When the local computer is turned **ON** again, it performs an **Intellectual Intake**:
1.  It reviews everything discussed with the "Scout" (DeepSeek).
2.  It converts those conversations into new Knowledge Items.
3.  **Local Absorption**: The local model (Gemma 3) reads these new items. 
4.  **Result**: The AI "remembers" what you discussed while the PC was off, re-integrating that intelligence back into its private, sovereign core.

## 4. Your Role
As a Team Member with **ADMIN** access, your goal is to interact with **Noor**, review these Knowledge Items, and use them to guide our beneficiary campaigns.
