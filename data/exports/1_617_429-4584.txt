Hello!

My name is Saya and I’m in the US. I’m reaching out because Wafaa asked me if I would make a campaign link for her because she’s not be able to reach you regarding her campaign. I already host several campaigns and can’t take on more at this point. So I thought I’d see if I could try to reach you and see if there’s been a misunderstanding or some reason why she’s not been able to reach you. 



Thanks so much. Hope to hear back from you

don't you worry for Wafaa, Wafaa is my best friend and prefered sister in Gaza. I really apologize if you get too worried, we are really working day and night to find a positive and surprisingly good issue to this ordeal. And keep my contact, because what I'm building could help you a lot too..

All I know is she was very much in need of the funds from her campaign and she had not heard from you after leaving several messages. So if you have not been in touch directly with her, please do so.
