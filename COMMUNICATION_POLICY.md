# Communication & Publication Policy

## 1. Primordial Transparency
Every campaign description and beneficiary communication must clearly state the conversion and disbursement logic. We do not hide the "friction" of the digital economy; we explain it.

## 2. The Batching Strategy (The €100 Threshold)
- **Problem**: Small international transfers (e.g., €10-€30) incur fixed fees that can consume up to 50% of the donation.
- **Solution**: Funds are held in a secure, audited accumulation phase.
- **Trigger**: A disbursement is only initiated once a beneficiary's sub-total reaches **€100**.
- **Benefit**: This ensures that 95-97% of the donor's money reaches the destination, rather than being lost to banking intermediaries.

## 3. Monday Reporting Cycle
Every Monday, a status report must be generated and analyzed.
- **Weekend Recap**: Campaigns created and funds raised during the Saturday-Sunday window.
- **Debt Status**: Total outstanding debt across the 177+ campaigns.
- **Snowball Priority**: Identification of beneficiaries who have crossed the threshold and are ready for payout.

## 4. WhatsApp Etiquette
- **Tone**: Empathetic but professional and data-driven.
- **Verification**: Always include a "Campaign ID" or "Ledger Link" when discussing balances to reduce ambiguity.
- **Proactive Updates**: Beneficiaries should be updated when they cross 25%, 50%, and 75% of the payout threshold.
